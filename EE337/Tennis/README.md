<p align="center"><img width="50%" src="tennis-scoreboard-simulator-screen.png" alt="Tennis Scoreboard Simulator" /></p>

I have made few additions to the problem statement.
I feel that these additions doens't change or add any logic/features that are not required.
These features are what I feel 'necessary' and/or are good programming practices.
